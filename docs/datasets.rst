CloudDrift provides convenience functions to access real-world ragged-array
datasets.

    summary:           Global Drifter Program hourly data
    title:             Global Drifter Program hourly drifting buoy collection

Currently available datasets are:

- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.andro`: The ANDRO dataset as a ragged array
  processed from the upstream dataset hosted at the `SEANOE repository
  <https://www.seanoe.org/data/00360/47077/>`_.
- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.gdp1h`: 1-hourly Global Drifter Program (GDP) data
  from a `cloud-optimized Zarr dataset on AWS <https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-oar-hourly-gdp/.>`_.
- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.gdp6h`: 6-hourly GDP data from a ragged-array
  NetCDF file hosted by the public HTTPS server at
  `NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) <https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp/index.php>`_.
- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.glad`: 15-minute Grand LAgrangian Deployment (GLAD)
  data produced by the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of
  Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) and hosted upstream at the `Gulf of
  Mexico Research Initiative Information and Data Cooperative (GRIIDC)
  <https://doi.org/10.7266/N7VD6WC8>`_.
- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.mosaic`: MOSAiC sea-ice drift dataset as a ragged
  array processed from the upstream dataset hosted at the
  `NSF's Arctic Data Center <https://doi.org/10.18739/A2KP7TS83>`_.
- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.subsurface_floats`: The subsurface float trajectories dataset as
  hosted by NOAA AOML at 
  `NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) <https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/float_traj/index.php>_`
  and maintained by Andree Ramsey and Heather Furey from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.spotters`: The Sofar Ocean Spotters archive dataset as hosted at the public `AWS S3 bucket <https://sofar-spotter-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/spotter_data_bulk_zarr>`_.
- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.yomaha`: The YoMaHa'07 dataset as a ragged array
  processed from the upstream dataset hosted at the `Asia-Pacific Data-Research
  Center (APDRC) <http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/yomaha/>`_.
- :func:`clouddrift.datasets.hurdat2`: The HURricane DATa 2nd generation (HURDAT2)
  processed from the upstream dataset hosted at the `NOAA AOML Hurricane Research Devision <https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html>`_.

The GDP and the Spotters datasets are accessed lazily, so the data is only downloaded when
specific array values are referenced. The ANDRO, GLAD, MOSAiC, Subsurface Floats, and YoMaHa'07
datasets are downloaded in their entirety when the function is called for the first 
time and stored locally for later use.
