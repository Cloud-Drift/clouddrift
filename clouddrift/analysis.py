    """Compute velocity from arrays of positions and time.

    x and y can be provided as longitude and latitude in degrees if
    coord_system == "spherical" (default), or as easting and northing if
    coord_system == "cartesian".

    The units of the result are meters per unit of time if
    coord_system == "spherical". For example, if the time is provided in the
    units of seconds, the resulting velocity is in the units of meters per
    second. Otherwise, if coord_system == "cartesian", the units of the
    resulting velocity correspond to the units of the input. For example,
    if Easting and Northing are in the units of kilometers and time is in
    the units of hours, the resulting velocity is in the units of kilometers
    per hour.

    x, y, and time can be multi-dimensional arrays. If the time axis, along
    which the finite differencing is performed, is not the last one (i.e.
    x.shape[-1]), use the time_axis optional argument to specify along which
    axis should the differencing be done. x, y, and time must have the same
    shape.

    Difference scheme can take one of three values:

        1. "forward" (default): finite difference is evaluated as
           dx[i] = dx[i+1] - dx[i];
        2. "backward": finite difference is evaluated as
           dx[i] = dx[i] - dx[i-1];
        3. "centered": finite difference is evaluated as
           dx[i] = (dx[i+1] - dx[i-1]) / 2.

    Forward and backward schemes are effectively the same except that the
    position at which the velocity is evaluated is shifted one element down in
    the backward scheme relative to the forward scheme. In the case of a
    forward or backward difference scheme, the last or first element of the
    velocity, respectively, is extrapolated from its neighboring point. In the
    case of a centered difference scheme, the start and end boundary points are
    evaluated using the forward and backward difference scheme, respectively.

    Args:
        x (array_like): An N-d array of x-positions (longitude in degrees or easting in any unit)
        y (array_like): An N-d array of y-positions (latitude in degrees or northing in any unit)
        time (array_like): An N-d array of times as floating point values (in any unit)
        coord_system (str, optional): Coordinate system that x and y arrays are in; possible values are "spherical" (default) or "cartesian".
        difference_scheme (str, optional): Difference scheme to use; possible values are "forward", "backward", and "centered".
        time_axis (int, optional): Axis along which to differentiate (default is -1)

    Returns:
        out (Tuple[xr.DataArray[float], xr.DataArray[float]]): Arrays of x- and y-velocities
